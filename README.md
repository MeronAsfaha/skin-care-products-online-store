# Skin-care Products App

## Summary:

The SkinCareProductsMEAN application is a user-friendly platform dedicated to skincare enthusiasts. Developed using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack, this application provides a seamless experience for users to explore and discover a wide range of skincare products. With a strong focus on security, the app implements API Hardening, uses promises (avoiding callbacks), and employs JWT (JSON Web Token) security along with bcrypt encryption for robust data protection.

## Features:

### 1. Extensive Product Catalog:

- A comprehensive catalog of skincare products for users to browse and explore.
- Detailed product information including ingredients, usage instructions, and customer reviews.

### 2. User Authentication and Security:

- JWT security implementation for secure user authentication.
- Bcrypt encryption for sensitive data such as user passwords.

### 3. MEAN Stack Architecture:

- MongoDB for efficient and flexible data storage.
- Express.js for building scalable and modular backend APIs.
- Angular for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- Node.js for server-side runtime, enabling efficient JavaScript execution.

### 4. API Hardening:

- Rigorous security measures applied to API endpoints to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- Regular security audits and updates to ensure a robust defense against potential threats.

### 5. Promises Over Callbacks:

- Implementation of promises for asynchronous operations, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- Improved error handling and streamlined execution flow for better performance.

## Technologies Used:

### 1. MongoDB:

- NoSQL database for efficient and scalable storage of skincare product data.

### 2. Express.js:

- Web application framework for building robust and scalable APIs.

### 3. Angular:

- Front-end framework for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

### 4. Node.js:

- Server-side runtime for executing JavaScript code efficiently.

### 5. JWT (JSON Web Token) Security:

- Secure and stateless authentication mechanism for user identity verification.

### 6. Bcrypt Encryption:

- Strong cryptographic hashing for securing sensitive data, especially user passwords.

### 7. API Hardening Techniques:

- Advanced security measures implemented to protect API endpoints from potential threats.
